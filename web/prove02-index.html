                    <p><strong>CHARGE</strong> syndrome is a recognizable genetic syndrome with known pattern of
                        features.
                        It is an extremely complex syndrome, involving extensive medical and physical difficulties that
                        differ from child to child. Babies with CHARGE syndrome are often born with life-threatening
                        birth
                        defects. They spend many months in the hospital and undergo many surgeries and other treatments.
                        Swallowing and breathing problems make life difficult even when they come home. Most have
                        hearing
                        loss, vision loss, and balance problems that delay their development and communication. Despite
                        these seemingly insurmountable obstacles, children with CHARGE syndrome often far surpass their
                        medical, physical, educational, and social expectations.</p>
                    <p>Continued <a href="https://www.chargesyndrome.org/research/">research</a> is needed to help us
                        understand the <a
                            href="https://www.chargesyndrome.org/for-families/medical-features/">medical</a>
                        and developmental challenges facing individuals with CHARGE. This understanding leads the way to
                        medical and <a href="https://www.chargesyndrome.org/for-families/education/">educational</a>
                        interventions and <a
                            href="https://www.chargesyndrome.org/for-families/education/school-years/therapies/">
                            therapies</a> which help people with CHARGE syndrome overcome many of the obstacles in their
                        lives.</p>
                    <p>One of the hidden features of CHARGE syndrome is the determination and strong character these
                        children display.</p>
                    <p><strong>History of the name “CHARGE”</strong><br />
                        The name “CHARGE” was a clever way (in 1981) to refer to a newly recognized cluster of features
                        seen
                        in a number of children. Over the years, it has become clear that CHARGE is indeed a syndrome
                        and at
                        least one gene causing CHARGE syndrome has been discovered. The letters in CHARGE stand for:
                        Coloboma
                        of the eye, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retardation of growth and development, and
                        Ear
                        abnormalities and deafness. Those features are no longer used in making a

                        of
                        CHARGE syndrome, but we’re not changing the name.*</p>

                    <p><strong>Dandy-Walker Syndrome</strong> is a congenital brain malformation involving the
                        cerebellum
                        (an area at the back of the brain that controls movement) and the fluid filled spaces around it.
                        The
                        key features of this syndrome are an enlargement of the fourth ventricle (a small channel that
                        allows
                        fluid to flow freely between the upper and lower areas of the brain and spinal cord), a partial
                        or
                        complete absence of the cerebellar vermis (the area between the two cerebellar hemispheres), and
                        cyst
                        formation near the internal base of the skull. An increase in the size of the fluid spaces
                        surrounding the brain as well as an increase in pressure may also be present. The syndrome can
                        appear dramatically or develop unnoticed. Symptoms, which often occur in early infancy, include
                        slow motor development and progressive enlargement of the skull. In older children, symptoms of
                        increased intracranial pressure such as irritability, vomiting, and convulsions, and signs of
                        cerebellar dysfunction such as unsteadiness, lack of muscle coordination, or jerky movements of
                        the
                        eyes may occur. Other symptoms include increased head circumference, bulging at the back of the
                        skull, problems with the nerves that control the eyes, face and neck, and abnormal breathing
                        patterns. Dandy-Walker Syndrome is frequently associated with disorders of other areas of the
                        central
                        nervous system including absence of the corpus callosum and malformations of the heart, face,
                        limbs,
                        fingers and toes.* </p>
